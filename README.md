### Bill Creator (Others)
It is a simple bill creator app, created using a bit of intermediate Tkinter.
It uses Tkinter and openpyxl libraries to create tax invoice (Sale bills), of a particular format only, automatically.
The format used in this app is the one which one of my relatives needed so I made it like that. To try the app simply run the Bills.exe file,
and your bills will automatically be created and stored in the C Drive once you are ready to go.
